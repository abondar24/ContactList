# ContactList
Dummy React Native App - Just another contact list.


Based on [video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npe3Wf4tpSg&list=WL&index=18&t=31326s).

Uses this [app](https://truly-contacts.herokuapp.com/) as a backend.

## Build and run

- In contacts directory run

```
npm install

npm run android
```

- Start a metro dev server

```
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Known issues

- Logout doesn't redirect to login screen if the app was moved to the background before


## To implement

- Call buttons do nothing,
- Some functionality in settings is missing.
